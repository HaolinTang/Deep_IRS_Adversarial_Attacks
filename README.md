# Deep_IRS_Adversarial_Attacks

This repository includes the source codes of the paper "Security Hardening of Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces Against Adversarial Machine Learning Attacks". (F. O. Catak, M. Kuzlu, H. Tang, E. Catak and Y. Zhao, in IEEE Access, vol. 10, pp. 100267-100275, 2022, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3206012) 

## Dataset:
To examine the performance of the AI-powered IRS model in this paper, a publicly available ray-tracing-based DeepMIMO dataset is adopted to generate the training dataset. The generated dataset is available at (See [Deep IRS](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Q5cjKFnFkQS7dDLY-V1Dgt9jvRrtfe2P?usp=drive_link)).

## Citation:
If you in any way use this code for research that results in publications, please cite our original article.
